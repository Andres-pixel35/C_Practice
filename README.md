#C

Once finished the CS50 course I fell in love with C, I didn't want to give up on C so I decided to keep practicing and improve my skills in C.

## What does this repo has?

From simple C exercices to more complex ones, mainly anything I want to do in C. Some of them are quite bigger and will have their own repo when finished.

## May I use your code?

If for any reason someone found this code useful, you may used as long as it's not for economic activity. If it is for a personal project or educational purposes you may use it without ask and without credits.

Which, I don't belive would happen since itÂ´s pretty simple code, but whp knows...
